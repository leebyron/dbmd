Yet another dropbox hosted CMS where individual pages are markdown files.

First run the access token script.

    > ./bin/get-access-token.js

This will spit out a url to open, open it, accept the permissions dialog, then
hit enter in the console. It will give you a bunch of tokens. Copy those into
settings.json.

You'll get a directory in your dropbox at `Dropbox/Apps/markdown/`

Put drafts files in `./drafts`

If you want to force a reload of your changes in dropbox (perhaps to preview a
file you're working on), then pass ?force=1 in the URL.

If you want to see *all* (time based) pages, pass ?showall=1 to the index page.
You will have to enter your user/pass to be able to do this.

Markdown files have a header with some custom information:

    Title: Page's Title
    Author: Custom Author
    Date: Jan 1st, 2001 3:45pm
    Raw: true
    CSS: custom_style.css
    Template: custom_template.mustache
    Permalink: page-title alt-title deep/title
    Synopsis: syposis.markdown
    Tags: awesome silly fun

Deploying is based on Rasmus's awesome template:
